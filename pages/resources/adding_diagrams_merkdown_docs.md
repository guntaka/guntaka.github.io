A nice article on adding diagrams to markdown documents is [here](https://dzone.com/articles/adding-mermaid-diagrams-to-markdown-documents)


The article demostates how to use [Jamal](https://github.com/verhas/jamal) to integrate [MermaidJS](https://mermaid.js.org/) in markdown documents. This approach also works for other diagramming tools as well.
